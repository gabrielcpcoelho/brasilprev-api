# If use Eclipse to make test

If you decide to use the Eclipse IDE to make the tests, first is necessary downloading the Lombok, becouse I decide to use it to make easier use getters and setters.
You can download it in the website https://projectlombok.org/download

After download it you need to import the project as Maven Project and the API will be ready to test.

# If use just the command line

if you decide to use only the command line, just use the following command line:
mvn spring-boot:run

For more information, I included in the repository a power point that has all implementation like a flow. The archive name is Atividades Teste Brasilprev.pptx. In this archive I describe all endpoints and your respective JSON.
